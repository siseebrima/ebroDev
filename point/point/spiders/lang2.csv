Acer Swift 3 review: Better as a budget device than as a mid-range laptop,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/acerswift3_2-760x380.jpg,Our $899 review unit isn't very different from its $479 counterpart.,Valentina Palladino,2019-10-17,Includes USB-A ports and an HDMI port,16:9 aspect ratio,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/acer-swift-3-review-better-as-a-budget-device-than-as-a-mid-range-laptop/,1583717,Acer Swift 3 ,"So while the Acer Swift 3 doesn't have any glaring imperfections, it doesn't provide as much value as other laptops in or near its price range. Many of the necessary features are there on paper—metal body, fingerprint sensor, USB-C along with USB-A, decent battery life, and more—but the Swift 3 doesn't push those features quite as far as I need them to go to recommend it in the $899 configuration that I tested. When I can get more for my money, I almost always will do so, and there are other laptops that give you more for the same price.",gadgets
Garmin Venu review: Fitness expertise with many pixels left to fill,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/venu20-760x380.jpg,"Garmin dives into AMOLED with this $399 smartwatch, but the execution is shallow.",Valentina Palladino,2019-10-15,Bold and bright AMOLED display.,Only one case size.,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/garmin-venu-review-fitness-expertise-with-many-pixels-left-to-fill/,1581763,Garmin Venu ,"However, I do believe Garmin can make its software more AMOLED-friendly by using more exciting graphics and animations while also maintaining the stellar battery life that the Venu currently has. Garmin wearables may never be as intuitive as Apple's or Samsung's because they aren't as closely tied to a smartphone OS, but the company can certainly make the experience of using a $399 smartwatch feel more appropriate. If users can get the exact same software experience on a $350 device as they can on a $399 device, most users (who are not display sticklers) will likely choose the more affordable option.",gadgets

Some business customers also favor ThinkPads' nondescript design, and you won't get that in an HP business notebook in the same class. But the new Elitebooks are formidable opponents for Lenovo's business notebooks, and customers shouldn't overlook the middle child in the Elitebook x360 family. It's definitely worth the extra cost if you enjoy having a relatively large screen in a small convertible, but those who aren't as picky about screen real estate can opt for the slightly less expensive 13-inch model.",gadgets

Maybe we'll get that in the future, but for now, those considering the Pixelbook Go should only look closely at the two most affordable options.

Huawei should ditch most of the premium components, sacrifice a bit in the quality of the AMOLED display, introduce a smaller case size, and maybe even remove the onboard GPS and add a connected GPS feature.

Less successful, for me, is the Peking Duck. It tries to be the pizza for the guy who wanted Chinese food but finds himself instead in a pizza parlor. It's trying too hard. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition) has reached just a little too far in the interest of features and costs. And what rewards are garnered by those concessions to cost? With a sticker price of $550, the savings certainly aren't being passed on to the buyer.

Your decision to choose between the Google Play Edition of the Samsung Galaxy S 4 and Samsung's out-of-the-box version depends entirely on your own experience with the handset. I mostly enjoyed being able to use stock Android on the Galaxy S 4's form-factor. It's a stylish phone that feels good to hold in the palm of the hand, but it's made even better with stock Android as a part of the equation. The biggest setback may be how soon Google will push out updates for the phones, but the search giant has said that it's not solely responsible for the updates on the Google Play Edition of the phone. Samsung handles the kernel, while Google is merely behind the software that sits on top of it. In the end, this might be the deciding factor. If Samsung won't keep the Google Play Edition S 4's software up to date, its value will be significantly diminished.",gadgets

The 2012 Nexus 7 and Nexus 4 were merely great for the price; the 2013 Nexus 7 and the Nexus 5 are mostly just great. There are lots of areas where we'd prefer the M8 Google Play edition to the Nexus 5 if we were in the market for a phone with a clean version of Android, all else being equal. All else isn't equal, though. By our totally unscientific estimates, the Nexus 5 gets you a phone that is 85 to 90 percent as good as the M8 for 50 percent of the money. Even if you don't think the Nexus 5 is the most exciting phone in the world, that's basically impossible to pass up.",gadgets

Apple has come closer to defining the practical value of the smartwatch with the Series 2 and watchOS 3, but I still need some convincing. The watch continues to feel non-essential when compared to Apple products like the obviously essential iPhone, and for now that will keep it in a relatively small niche.",gadgets
Huawei Mate 9 review: A big phone with enough battery,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mate9new_2-760x380.jpg,"We still don't like Emotion UI, but at least the €699 handset itself is good.",Valentina Palladino,2016-11-18,Good overall performance.,Lots of crapware that you can't delete.,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/11/huawei-mate-9-review-a-big-phone-with-enough-battery/,993361,Huawei Mate 9 ,"I also wish the camera performed better in low-light situations, but it does have a lot of other redeeming qualities, especially if you like manipulating photos before and after you take them. My main concerns now lie with the uncertainty of the Mate 9's availability in the US—we know it's coming, we just don't know when or how much it will cost. Huawei told me that information will be available in the next few months. We do know it will cost €699 overseas, which would put it around the $750 mark in the US. If that's the case, anyone as dissatisfied with Emotion UI as we are would be better off with a Google Pixel, and anyone looking for a cheaper phone would do well to look at the OnePlus 3 or 3T instead. The Mate 9's battery life is great, but it's really the only way in which the phone distinguishes itself from the crowd.",gadgets

While audio manufacturers can use the best heart rate monitors in their products and give you a plethora of ear wings and tips to choose from, you have to do the work to get the best fit with the earbuds you buy. You'll also have to resist fiddling with the earbuds during a workout, which can be difficult since I tend to do that myself. But the better the fit and the less movement they are subjected to, the more accurate earbud trackers will be. Maybe by the end of 2017 we'll see some earbud trackers performing just as well, if not better, than traditional fitness trackers.",gadgets

You need to like Apple’s EarPod design and be OK with the way they sound and fit in your ear—the audio quality in the AirPods is noticeably better, but it’s not night-and-day. To get the most out of them, you’ll want to be embedded deeply into Apple’s ecosystem, since only Apple devices can seamlessly pair with the headphones. And you’ll need to have plenty of money—enough to spend $159 on these in the first place, and enough to spend $69 replacing individual AirPods or $49 replacing their batteries when they are inevitably lost or degraded. The pairing and charging experience is better than standard Bluetooth headphones, but once you’re using the AirPods, they aren’t all that different.",gadgets
